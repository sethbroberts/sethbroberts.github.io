From the [Jupyter page][jupyter]: "Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more."

Originally, this was called an iPython notebook and was restricted to coding in Python. Now there are kernels to use the Jupyter notebook idea for many different languages, including Julia, Scala, Ruby, Perl, and of course [Javascript][javascriptkernel].

Basically, this is like an interactive console on steroids, with many, many cool features. Here is a screenshot:

Here is how I got it up and running on my OSX. Full install instructions for OSX and other machines can be found [here][install].

1. install [Anaconda Python][anaconda]. You'll be glad you did. Totally awesome free Python distribution with >300 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, and data analysis included.

2. use the conda installer from above to install Jupyter:

{% highlight bash %}
$ conda install jupyter
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can write notebooks with Python. But you want JavaScript. Keep reading.

3. Install [homebrew][homebrew] (if you don't have it...I skipped this, already on my machine).

4. Use brew to install some necessary stuff.

{% highlight bash %}
$ brew install pkg-config zeromq
{% endhighlight %}

5. Install some other dependencies using [pip][pip].

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip install --upgrade ipython jinja2 tornado jsonschema pyzmq
{% endhighlight %}

6. Finally, install the JavaScript kernel for Jupyter.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo npm install -g ijavascript
{% endhighlight %}

Or you can install locally.

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install ijavascript
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you are ready to go.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ijs
{% endhighlight %}

and start exploring. It's awesome.
