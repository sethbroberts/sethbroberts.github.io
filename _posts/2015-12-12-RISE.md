Here's one more post related to [Jupyter][jupyter]. 

As you will discover if you play around with a Jupyter notebook, it is possible to export it in a number of formats. For example, if you are writing Javascript, you can export the notebook to a .js file. You can also export it as html, PDF, or even a [Reveal.js][reveal]-powered HTML slide show.

This is cool. But even cooler is the [RISE extension][rise], which allows you to export the notebook to a Reveal.js-style slide show, except that RISE allows you to LIVE-CODE IN YOUR SLIDES. You can declare variables, write functions, require libraries, evaluate code cells, and more, without ever exiting your slide show.

To install: 
1. make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed (see previous post)
2. get a copy of the RISE repo
3. open terminal, go into the main folder of the repo
4. type the following:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python setup.py install
{% endhighlight %}

That should do it.

So now, how do you make slides from your notebook? Start up the notebook from the command line. To open Jupyter with the javascript kernel, I type this on the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ijs
{% endhighlight %}

That takes you to a navigator. Start a new notebook or find the one you're working on. Once it's open, look at the toolbar and find the drop down called "Cell Toolbar". Click that and choose "Slideshow".

Once you've done that, each cell has a drop down at the upper right called "Slide Type". Check out the different choices, play around with them, you will quickly figure out how this links different cells into a slide show.

After you've arranged things a bit, you are ready to run your show. Click the button on the toolbar just to the right of the "Cell Toolbar" dropdown.

As you move through your slides, notice that you can enter any cell, edit its contents, and if it's code, you can run the contents of the cell with the standard "shift+enter" key combination.

Enjoy the awesome.
